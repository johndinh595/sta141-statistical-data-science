REGION is the smallest geographic unit identified in the IPUMS NHIS data for 1985 forward.  In 1968-1984, a limited number (under 30) of metropolitan areas were also identified (METAREA).

The four regions--Northeast, North Central/Midwest, South, and West--correspond to the U.S. regions recognized by the Census Bureau. Divisions and states included in the four regions are as follows:

Northeast:  New England Division (Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut) and Middle Atlantic Division (New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania)

North Central/Midwest: East North Central Division (Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin) and West North Central Division (Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri, North Dakota, South Dakota, Kansas, and Nebraska)

South: South Atlantic Division (Delaware, Maryland, District of Columbia, Virginia, West Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida), East South Central Division (Kentucky, Tennessee, Mississippi, and Alabama), and West South Central Division (Texas, Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Louisiana)

      <txt><![CDATA[For sample adults and sample children, URBRRL reports whether the household lives in a large central metro county, large fringe metro county, medium and small metro county, or nonmetropolitan county.

County Classification Scheme&nbsp;Counties are assigned to one of six levels according to the 2013 NCHS Classification Scheme, which are further collapsed to four levels in the NHIS public use files. The classification scheme "was developed for use in studying associations between urbanization level of residence and health and for monitoring the health of urban and rural residents." Users interested in more detail about how the classification scheme was developed and applied can see 2013 NCHS Urban-Rural Classification Scheme for Counties. Below is a brief description of how counties are categorized.

Counties designated as "Large central metro" are counties in MSAs (metropolitan statistical areas) with a population of 1 million or more that contain the entire population of the largest principal city, have their entire population in the largest principal city, or contain at least 250,000 inhabitants of any principal city of the MSA. "Large fringe metro" are counties in MSAs with a population of 1 million or more that do not qualify as large central metro counties. "Medium and small metro" are counties in MSAs with a population of less than 1 million. "Nonmetropolitan" are counties that are not in an MSA.After the 2019 redesign, there is no longer a sampling weight to produce household population estimates.

      <txt><![CDATA[SAMPWEIGHT is an IPUMS NHIS-constructed variable that represents, with a few exceptions, the random selection of a sample person in the household to complete a supplement survey.  (The exceptions to this generalization are the 1983 health insurance supplement and 1993 health insurance, access to care, and family resources supplements, which were asked of all persons in the second half of the year.)

For survey years 1997 forward, SAMPWEIGHT is based on the Final Annual Sample Adult and Sample Child Weights in the original NHIS public use files. This weight should be used with variables taken from the sample adult or sample child supplements for 1997 on (as indicated by the supplement title in the "Source" section toward the top of each variable description). 

SAMPWEIGHT also contains the sampling weights for a subset of the pre-1997 supplements, for which the definition of a sample person, and the rules governing the selection of sample persons, are less consistent. The universe statements for SAMPWEIGHT document who was included in the supplements requiring use of this weight on a year-by-year basis. SAMPWEIGHT consistently represents the inverse probability of selection into a supplement, adjusted for non-response with additional post-stratification adjustments for age, race/ethnicity, and sex using the Census Bureau's population control totals.

Users should review the documentation for extracted variables--most notably the "Weights" section toward the top of each variable description--to ascertain which weight is the appropriate choice for a given survey year.

      <txt><![CDATA[LONGWEIGHT is the final Longitudinal Weight offered in the original NHIS public use files. LONGWEIGHT was created to allow analysis of individual-level changes from 2019 to 2020 in the longitudinal sample.

Due to the coronavirus pandemic in 2020, about half of the original NHIS sample allocated for the last five months of 2020 was replaced with persons that completed a Sample Adult interview in the 2019 NHIS. This group of sample adults that completed interviews in the 2019 and 2020 NHIS are referred to as the "longitudinal" sample. Persons in the longitudinal sample were interviewed for the 2020 NHIS at least 12 months after their initial 2019 interview date. According to the 2020 Survey Description, the longitudinal sample was introduced "due to concerns about possible loss of coverage and lower response rates typically associated with telephone interviewing." See the user note on COVID-related changes to the NHIS for more information. Due to methodological concerns, sample children were not included in the longitudinal sample.

Researchers may use NHISPID in 2019 and NHISPIDPRVYR in 2020 to link the longitudinal sample across these two years of data. Please see NHISPIDPRVYR for more information.

      <txt><![CDATA[PARTWEIGHT is the final Partial Weight offered in the original NHIS public use files. PARTWEIGHT was created to allow estimates that are based only on the respondents from the original 2020 NHIS sample (i.e., excluding the longitudinal sample). According to the 2020 Survey Description, PARTWEIGHT is only recommended for use with 2020 data when pooling 2019 and 2020 data to increase sample size. In that case, SAMPWEIGHT should be used as the weight for the 2019 data. A user might, for example, create a new weight and assign PARTWEIGHT values for 2020 and SAMPWEIGHT values for 2019.

Due to the coronavirus pandemic in 2020, about half of the original NHIS sample allocated for the last five months of 2020 was replaced with persons that completed a Sample Adult interview in the 2019 NHIS. This group of sample adults that completed interviews in the 2019 and 2020 NHIS are referred to as the "longitudinal" sample. PARTWEIGHT does not include sample adults from the longitudinal sample. See the user note on COVID-related changes to the NHIS for more information.

      <txt><![CDATA[ASTATFLG identifies the record of a sample adult. A sample adult is the one person over age 18 per household who is randomly selected to complete the sample adult questionnaire. For 1997-2018, a sample adult is the one adult per family who was selected at random by the computerized survey instrument to answer additional health-related questions, under the survey design instituted in 1997.  All persons other than sample adults (those not having the value 1 in ASTATFLG) are coded as "not in universe" for variables derived from the additional questions asked only of sample adults.  (Some additional questions were asked of both sample adults and sample children.)  Every adult in each family, except for active duty armed forces members, was eligible to be selected as the sample adult.  

Prior to 2019, ASTATFLG has the value "no one selected as sample adult" (code 4) for all adults in the family in the following two cases: 1) sample adult status was incorrectly assigned to someone in the armed forces, or 2) it could not be ascertained which adult in the family was chosen as sample adult.   

For 2020 only, SALNGPRTFLG further distinguishes between sample adults included in the longitudinal sample and sample adults included in the partial sample. Please see the user note on COVID-related changes to the NHIS for more information on the longitudinal and partial samples.

A similar flag variable, CSTATFLG, identifies the record of a sample child.

      <txt><![CDATA[For sample adults ages 18 and older, SEXORIEN reports the person's sexual orientation. Respondents were asked "Which of the following best represents how you think of yourself?" Response options included: "gay" or "lesbian", "straight, that is, not lesbian or gay", "bisexual", "something else", and "I don't know the answer". The wording of the question differed slightly for men and women, with men being asked if they are "gay" or "straight, that is, not gay" and women being asked if they are "lesbian or gay" or "straight, that is, not lesbian or gay". Persons who responded "something else" or "I don't know the answer" were asked follow-up questions about what they meant by "something else" or "don't know," but due to sample size constraints, those responses are not included in the publicly-available data.

SEXORIEN was first introduced in 2013. Users interested in learning more about the cognitive testing involved in developing the NHIS sexual orientation questions can refer to the NHIS question evaluation report.]]></txt>

      <labl>Educational attainment</labl>
      <txt><![CDATA[For sample adults (and, prior to 2019, for all persons aged 5 and older), EDUC reports the highest level of schooling an individual had completed, in terms of completed grades for persons with less than a high school degree, and in terms of degrees attained for high school graduates and those with higher education.  Respondents were handed a card listing recognized categories and asked to identify the correct category.

According to the Field Representative's Manuals for 1997-2000, only "regular schooling which advances a person toward an elementary or high school diploma, or a college/university/professional school (such as law, medicine, dentistry)" counted as education.  Schooling in settings other than "regular schools" counted only if the credits obtained were acceptable in a regular school system.  Thus, for example, "adult education" classes not taken for credit or for the attainment of a college degree did not count.  

For the end of high school, EDUC distinguishes between those who completed twelfth grade but did not attain a diploma (e.g., those who failed to pass state-mandated high school exit examinations), those who graduated from high school, and those passed the GED (General Equivalence Degree) Test (which certifies that the test taker has attained high school-level academic skills).  Persons who attained a high school diploma in less than twelve years were to be recorded as "high school graduates," a guideline consistent with EDUC's emphasis on degrees attained rather than years spent in the classroom.  The Field Representative's Manual for 1997-2000 directed interviewers to probe to determine whether persons who attended "post-graduate" high school classes but did not attend college had received a high school diploma.  

For nurses, interviewers were to determine whether training was received in a college or in a nursing school (with the grade completed at the last regular--non-nursing--school to be entered in the latter case).  For a person attending special education classes or a school for persons with mental, physical, or developmental difficulties, interviewers were to ask which grade in a regular school most closely matched the individual's education level.  Persons currently in school were generally assumed to have completed the previous grade.]]></txt>

Before 2019, EMPSTAT reports whether persons were part of the labor force--working or seeking work--and, if so, whether they worked, had a job or business from which they were temporarily absent, or were looking for work or on layoff during the preceding two weeks (for 1969-1996) or during the preceding week (for 1997-2018).

In 1969-1996, EMPSTAT is a summary recode of responses to a series of questions. 
&nbsp;In 1969-1973 interviewers first asked, "Did [person] work at any time last week or the week before - (For females): not counting work around the house?" This question was also asked in 1974-1981, but the wording in these years omitted the instructions "For females" before the phrase "not counting work around the house." In 1982-1996 the question wording was changed to, "During those 2 weeks, did [person] work at any time at a job or business, not counting work around the house? (Include unpaid work in the family farm/business.)

If the answer to the initial question asked in 1969-1996 was negative, interviewers asked whether the person had a job or business, even though he/she did not work during the reference period. The final questions used to categorize current employment status in 1969-1996 were, "Was he looking for work or on layoff from a job [during those 2 weeks]?" and, if yes, "Which--looking for work or on layoff from a job?"In 1997-2018, respondents were asked one general question to ascertain their employment status. 
&nbsp;Interviewers asked, "Which of the following was [person] doing last week?"  In 1997-2000 interviewers read the following possible responses: "Working at a job or business," "With a job or business but not at work," "Looking for work," and "Not working at a job or business."  Beginning in 2001, the response category "Working at a job or business" was split into two separate categories, "Working for pay at a job or business" and "Working, but not for pay, at a job or business."  The rest of the response categories in 2001-2018 are the same as in 1997-2000.In 2019 forward, EMPSTAT only indicates whether someone was employed or not employed in the last week.
&nbsp;Respondents are asked a series of questions that are used to code a final response to EMPSTAT:

"LAST WEEK, did you work for pay at a job or business?"

"Did you have a job or business LAST WEEK, but were temporarily absent due to illness, vacation, family or maternity leave, or some other reason?"

"What is the MAIN reason you were not working for pay at a job or business last week?"

"Does [sample adult] work for pay at a job or business?"
NCHS uses these responses to code an individual as "Employed" or "Not employed" in EMPSTAT. Those who indicate they were performing seasonal or contract work or were working at a job or business but not for pay are coded as "Employed."Definitions and Instructions]]></txt>

      <txt><![CDATA[For sample adults aged 18+ (and all persons age 18+ in 2004-2018) who worked at a paid or unpaid job or business last week, held a seasonal or contract position last week, or were not working last week because they were on vacation, on family/maternity leave, unable to work for health reasons, HOURSWRK reports the total hours that the sample person worked in the past week. or in the past two weeks at all jobs/ businesses or at the main job/business. The universe and time period for HOURSWRK were somewhat different for 1979 and 1991. HOURSWORK reports total hours worked in the past two weeks for sample persons aged 17+ in 1979 who, during the past 2 weeks, worked, had a job or business from which they were temporarily absent, or looked for work or were on layoff; in 1991, HOURSWORK reports total work hours worked in the  past two weeks for sample persons aged 18+ in 1991 who were employed in the past 2 weeks and worked for a private company or the federal, state, or local government. Please refer to the Universe and Comparability tabs for more information about changes in the universe, time period, and the types of jobs included in HOURSWRK.

Beginning in 2019, sample adults aged 18+ who held a seasonal or contract position last week continued to be identified by NCHS as included in the universe for HOURSWORK, but were omitted from the HOURSWRK question and had their responses set to "Unknown - Not Ascertained."]]></txt>

&nbsp;Starting with the 2007 NHIS, the income amount follow-up questions that had been in place since 1997 were replaced with a series of unfolding bracket questions. The unfolding bracket method asked a series of closed-ended income range questions (e.g., "Is it less than $50,000?") if the respondent did not provide an answer to the exact income amount question. The closed-ended income range questions were constructed so that each successive question establishes a smaller range for the amount of the family's income.]]></txt>
